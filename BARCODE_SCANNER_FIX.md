# Fix for expo-barcode-scanner Installation Error

## The Problem
The `expo-barcode-scanner` package has been deprecated in Expo SDK 53 and is no longer available. This is why you're getting the error:
```
npm error notarget No matching version found for expo-barcode-scanner@~14.0.11
```

## The Solution
I've updated your project to use `expo-camera` instead, which now includes barcode scanning functionality.

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed** `expo-barcode-scanner` from package.json and setup scripts
2. **Updated** setup scripts to use only `expo-camera`
3. **Package.json** now uses the correct dependencies for Expo SDK 53

### To Fix Your Installation:
1. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json`:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   ```
   
2. Run the setup script again:
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

### For Barcode Scanning in Your Code:
Instead of importing from `expo-barcode-scanner`, use `expo-camera`:

**Old way (deprecated):**
```javascript
import { BarCodeScanner } from 'expo-barcode-scanner';
```

**New way (current):**
```javascript
import { CameraView, Camera } from 'expo-camera';
```

The `CameraView` component has built-in barcode scanning capabilities with the `onBarcodeScanned` prop.

### Example Usage:
```javascript
import { CameraView, useCameraPermissions } from 'expo-camera';

export default function BarcodeScanner() {
  const [permission, requestPermission] = useCameraPermissions();

  const handleBarcodeScanned = ({ type, data }) => {
    console.log(`Barcode with type ${type} and data ${data} has been scanned!`);
  };

  if (!permission) {
    return <Text>Requesting camera permission...</Text>;
  }

  if (!permission.granted) {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>No access to camera</Text>
        <Button onPress={requestPermission} title="Grant permission" />
      </View>
    );
  }

  return (
    <CameraView
      style={{ flex: 1 }}
      onBarcodeScanned={handleBarcodeScanned}
      barcodeScannerSettings={{
        barcodeTypes: ["qr", "pdf417"],
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

This should resolve your installation issues and provide you with working barcode scanning functionality.
